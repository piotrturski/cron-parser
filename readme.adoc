= Cron expression parser

https://crontab.guru[Some] parsers / specs have very relaxed validation rules and allows eg:
`* \*,*/26 * * *` while https://www.freeformatter.com/cron-expression-generator-quartz.html[others]
treat it as an error. The following code also treats such expressions as an error.

== Build & run

With java 11, from the project directory:

 ./gradlew build shadowJar

 java -jar ./build/libs/cron-all.jar "* * * * * /bin/echo"
